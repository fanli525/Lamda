# Lamda

This repository contains pseudocode and implementation for the submitted paper "LAMDA: Two-Phase Multi-Fidelity HPO via Learning Promising Regions from Data". The code has been anonymized to comply with the review process.

Currently, we provide implementations for the following methods used in hyperparameter optimization (HPO):

Lamda+BOHB and BOHB
Lamda+MUMBO and MUMBO
Lamda+BO and BO
Lamda+RS and RS
We utilized the following packages for our implementations:

HpBandSter for BOHB and RS: https://github.com/automl/HpBandSter
Emukit for MUMBO: https://github.com/EmuKit/emukit/blob/main/notebooks/Emukit-tutorial-multi-fidelity-MUMBO-Example.ipynb
GPyOpt for Bayesian Optimization (BO): https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPyOpt
